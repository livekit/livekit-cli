# Use the official UV Python base image with Python 3.13 on Debian Bookworm
# UV is a fast Python package manager that provides better performance than pip
# We use the slim variant to keep the image size smaller while still having essential tools
ARG PYTHON_VERSION=3.13

# Keeps Python from buffering stdout and stderr to avoid situations where
# the application crashes without emitting any logs due to buffering.

# --- Build stage ---
# Install dependencies, build native extensions, and prepare the application
FROM base AS build

# Install build dependencies required for Python packages with native extensions
# gcc: C compiler needed for building Python packages with C extensions
# g++: C++ compiler needed for building Python packages with C++ extensions
# python3-dev: Python development headers needed for compilation
# We clean up the apt cache after installation to keep the image size down

# Create a new directory for our application code
# And set it as the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy just the dependency files first, for more efficient layer caching
COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./
RUN mkdir -p src

# Install Python dependencies using UV's lock file
# --locked ensures we use exact versions from uv.lock for reproducible builds
# This creates a virtual environment and installs all dependencies
# Ensure your uv.lock file is checked in for consistency across environments
RUN uv sync --locked

# Copy all remaining application files into the container
# This includes source code, configuration files, and dependency specifications
# (Excludes files specified in .dockerignore)
COPY . .

# Pre-download any ML models or files the agent needs
# This ensures the container is ready to run immediately without downloading
# dependencies at runtime, which improves startup time and reliability
RUN uv run "{{.ProgramMain}}" download-files

# --- Production stage ---
# Build tools (gcc, g++, python3-dev) are not included in the final image

# This improves security by not running as root

# Run the application using UV
# UV will activate the virtual environment and run the agent.
# The "start" command tells the worker to connect to LiveKit and begin waiting for jobs.
